Here is a comprehensive list of **100 Embedded C interview questions and answers** categorized by key topics for clarity:

---

### **Basic Concepts**
1. **What is Embedded C?**  
   *Answer:* A subset of C tailored for embedded systems, emphasizing direct hardware access, resource constraints, and real-time operations.

2. **How does Embedded C differ from standard C?**  
   *Answer:* Embedded C includes hardware-specific features like register manipulation, ISRs, and minimal library use due to resource limitations.

3. **What is the `volatile` keyword?**  
   *Answer:* It tells the compiler that a variable’s value can change unexpectedly (e.g., by hardware), preventing optimization that might skip reads/writes.

4. **What is a memory-mapped I/O?**  
   *Answer:* Hardware registers mapped to specific memory addresses, accessed via pointers (e.g., *(volatile uint32_t*)0x40000000`).

5. **Explain `const` vs. `volatile`.**  
   *Answer:* `const` prevents modification, while `volatile` ensures the compiler reads from memory every time.

---

### **Memory Management**
6. **Difference between stack and heap?**  
   *Answer:* Stack stores static data (local variables); heap stores dynamically allocated memory. Heap risks fragmentation in embedded systems.

7. **Why avoid `malloc()` in embedded systems?**  
   *Answer:* Dynamic allocation can cause fragmentation; static allocation is preferred for reliability.

8. **What are `.bss` and `.data` sections?**  
   *Answer:* `.bss` holds uninitialized static variables; `.data` holds initialized static variables.

9. **What is a linker script?**  
   *Answer:* Defines memory layout (ROM, RAM) and sections (code, data) for the compiled binary.

10. **What is a memory leak?**  
    *Answer:* Dynamically allocated memory not freed, reducing available memory over time.

---

### **Pointers**
11. **How to access a hardware register?**  
    *Answer:* `volatile uint8_t *reg = (volatile uint8_t*)0x1234;`

12. **What is a function pointer?**  
    *Answer:* A pointer storing a function’s address (e.g., void (*func_ptr)(int) = &foo;`).

13. **What is a NULL pointer?**  
    *Answer:* A pointer that does not point to valid memory (dereferencing causes crashes).

14. **How to use pointers for GPIO control?**  
    *Answer:* Map GPIO registers to pointers and manipulate bits (e.g., `GPIOA->ODR |= 0x01;`).

15. **What is a void pointer?**  
    *Answer:* A generic pointer type (e.g., `void *ptr`), requiring casting before use.

---

### **Interrupts**

    *Answer:* Interrupt Service Routine: a function executed when an interrupt occurs (e.g., timer overflow).

17. **Can you use `printf()` in an ISR?**  
    *Answer:* Avoid—it’s slow and non-reentrant. Use flags or buffers instead.

18. **How to share data between ISR and main code?**  
    *Answer:* Use `volatile` variables and disable interrupts during access for atomicity.

19. **What is interrupt latency?**  
    *Answer:* Time from interrupt trigger to ISR execution. Minimize by keeping ISRs short.

20. **What is a watchdog timer?**  
    *Answer:* Resets the system if not periodically refreshed, preventing hangs.

    *Answer:* `if (REG & (1 << 4)) { ... }`

25. **What is a bit field?**  
    *Answer:* A struct member with a specified bit width (e.g., `uint8_t flag : 1;`).

---

### **Peripherals**

    *Answer:* Synchronization primitive to manage shared resources (e.g., `xSemaphoreGive()`).

33. **Mutex vs. semaphore?**  
    *Answer:* Mutex ensures exclusive access; semaphore signals availability (e.g., resource count).

        rev |= (n & 1);
        n >>= 1;
